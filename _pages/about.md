Hello! My name is ChangHyun Nam a.k.a TabloNi.

I graduated Sunrin Internet High School and am attending Ajou University.

I am interested in development and project design, and I have many experience in activities and awards.

Development mainly uses popular languages such as JAVA, kotlin, C#, and Python. I mainly develop apps using Android studio, and I have various other experience using framework.

I have experience in various design-related fields such as UI design using Adobe xd and video production using Premier Pro.

I hope you check my portfolio for the project design, and I am currently working on various activities with the goal of a startup.
